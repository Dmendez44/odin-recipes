    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Mochi is a traditional Japanese food made from a variety of rice often referred to as glutinous rice in English (even
    though it contains no gluten). It is often eaten on its own, especially during New Year celebrations. However, it's most
    popularly filled with sweet fillings, including ice cream. Learn how to make your own with this recipe.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 pint ice cream (any flavor)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup sweet rice or glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 drop food coloring (any color)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Line a small baking sheet or an egg carton with plastic wrap. Scoop the ice cream into 8 tight round balls using a
        1-ounce cookie scoop (about 2 packed tablespoons each). Freeze on the prepared pan or in the egg carton cups until
        solid, at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Place a large piece of parchment paper on a work surface. Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust the parchment generously with
        cornstarch. (Use more cornstarch than you think you need — the dough will be very sticky.) In a large bowl, whisk the
        rice flour, sugar, water and food coloring until smooth. Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and cook over medium
        heat, stirring and folding with a rubber spatula, until a stiff tacky dough forms, 5 to 7 minutes. (It’s OK if it looks
        lumpy at first; it will smooth out.) The dough should be very thick and feel slightly tough and rubbery.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the parchment and dust the top generously with cornstarch. Place another piece of parchment over
        the dough and carefully press into a thin disk. Let the dough cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a large round or oval, about 1/4 inch thick. Using a 4- to 4 1/2-inch fluted or plain round
        cookie cutter, cut out as many rounds as possible. Gather the scraps to cut out more rounds, dusting with more
        cornstarch as needed (you should have at least 8 rounds). Dust a plate with cornstarch; make sure the dough rounds are
        dusted with cornstarch, then stack them on the plate and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the mochi: Use plastic gloves if you have them. Line a small baking sheet or a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with
        parchment paper, dust generously with cornstarch and place in the freezer. Fill a small dish with cool water. Working
        with one dough round at a time, gently brush off any excess cornstarch and place the round flat in your hand. Working
        quickly, place a scoop of ice cream into the center of the dough. Gently pull up the edges of the dough to enclose the
        ice cream, using a small dab of water if the seams aren’t sticking. Gently stretch, twist and pinch the dough together
        at the seams to secure. Immediately place the mochi seam-side down in the cold pan in the freezer. Repeat with the
        remaining dough rounds and ice cream balls. Cover the mochi with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Let
        soften for a few minutes before eating.</li>
